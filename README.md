# Blockchain-Backed Log Security System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
A Blockchain-Backed Log Security System that collects logs, stores them immutably in blockchain, and provides a secure dashboard for monitoring.  

The main problem: Hackers often tamper with or delete system logs during attacks, making investigations difficult.  
Our solution: Use blockchain to make logs **immutable**, ensuring they cannot be changed or deleted.  


## 👥 Team Members  
- **Alyazia** → Documentation & Literature Review  
- **Maitha** → Dashboard & UI Development  
- **Amna** → Flask API & Blockchain Integration  


## 🎯 Objectives  
- Collect logs in real-time using a Python log collector.  
- Securely transmit logs through a Flask API.  
- Store logs in **Blockchain (Hyperledger / Ethereum testnet)**.  
- Create a **Secure Dashboard** for admins to view and audit logs.  
- Test system under attacks, heavy loads, and real-world scenarios.  
- Document everything for academic and professional use.  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Blockchain:** Hyperledger / Ethereum Testnet  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript  
- **Database (indexing):** SQLite / MongoDB  
- **Visualization:** Chart.js / Bootstrap Dashboard  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **docs/ # Research papers, proposals, reports
- **src/ # Source code (log collector, Flask API, blockchain)
- **dashboard/ # Web dashboard code (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **tests/ # Scripts for performance and security testing
- **results/ # Test outputs, screenshots, evaluation reports
- **progress/ # Weekly notes and meeting updates
- **final/ # Final report, presentation, demo instructions

## 📅 Project Timeline (12 Weeks)  
1. Research & Proposal  
2. Literature Review (papers on blockchain logging)  
3. Design & System Architecture  
4. Build Log Collector & Flask API  
5. Blockchain Integration  
6. Dashboard Development  
7. Testing (attacks, performance, usability)  
8. Documentation & Final Report  


## 🚀 Expected Outcome  
By the end of the project, we will deliver:  
- A **working prototype** (log collector → Flask API → blockchain → dashboard).  
- A **secure dashboard** that verifies logs are untampered.  
- A **final report** with design, testing, and lessons learned.  
- A **presentation/demo** showing how blockchain ensures log immutability.
